#Lab 1 Password Generator
#Names: Kyle And Mathuran
#Date: 5/23/25
#Description: create a program which would generate a random strong
# password based on the usersâ€™ instructions. The user can decide the number of characters in
# their password along with the number of letters, digits, and special characters in their
# custom password. The program should be tested to all the extremes to ensure proper
# functioning.
